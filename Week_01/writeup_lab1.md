- I used the fields ASIAN_POP and TOTAL_POP to create a new field called %_ASIAN
- I used these fields to look at what percent of each California county population is Asian 
- Problems that this dataset could have is how recent this data was collected. I am not sure if this data was collected during the 2020 census survey or 2010 survey or possibly even earlier. As a result this data may not be completely accurate.
