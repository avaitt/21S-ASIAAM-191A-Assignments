                Hi, My Name is Adhvaith Vijay!

            <p>
                I am a Junior at UCLA studying Statistics. I am a transfer student so I've only been here a year, but entering UCLA has been one of the best decision of my life.
                Even though everything is online because of COVID-19, I can't say how lucky I am to spend my days interesting and smart people. After I finish my Bachelors, I intend
                on going to graduate school and want to specialize in Statistics/Data Science. One of my goals as a Data Scientist is to convey information to the general public that is
                both aesthetically pleasing, informative, and ethically sourced.          
            </p>
